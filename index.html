    <h1>Privacy Policy - AdVenture Match: Level Up</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: December 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how "AdVenture Match: Level Up" (the "App") handles user information and data, especially regarding advertising, as required by app distribution platforms.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Our App is a simple browser-based game. We collect and store minimal data primarily for game functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use your device's local storage to save your game progress (Tokens, Levels, User Name, Email, and Login status). This data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Email/Password:</strong> We store your provided email and encrypted password locally for future logins. We do not use this email for external communication unless required for support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Advertising (Adsterra)</h2>
    <p>This App uses third-party advertising services (e.g., Adsterra) for monetization. These partners may collect data to serve personalized and non-personalized advertisements.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Advertising partners may collect device identifiers (such as IP address) to serve relevant ads and measure ad performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Handling:</strong> We have no direct control over the data collected by third-party ad networks. We strongly recommend reviewing the privacy policies of our advertising partner, Adsterra, for detailed information on their data handling practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Consent and Your Rights</h2>
    <p>By using this App, you consent to the processing of your data as described in this Policy, including data processed by our third-party advertising partners.</p>
    <p>Since the game is locally stored on a browser, deletion of your browser's local storage will remove all game progress and login details.</p>

        <p>For any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or data concerns, please contact our support team at: **your.support.email@example.com** (Please replace this with your actual support email).</p>
        <p>A detailed Terms of Use is available at the provided link on the official page.</p>
